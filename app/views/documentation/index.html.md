# Introduction

<subtitle>Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.</subtitle>

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and
paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs.
The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
